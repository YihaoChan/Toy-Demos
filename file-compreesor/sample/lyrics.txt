Katrina (Demo)
Katrina I can't stop looking in your eyes
But my words don't come out straight
I don't know what to say
No. On monday i tell myself u gotta wait
Dave, don't rush it. Don't anticipate.
Take it slowly, it's ok it's ok
I just want a chance to know you to know
the woman deep inside
Yeah yeah(and)
I don't wanna look back on life
to see this missed opportunity
Yeah yeah even at the risk of looking like a fool to you,
On wednesday I casually walk on by to find that you're not there
I act like I don't care
But on friday I catch a glimpse of you I tell myself dont hesitate
You just walk up and say hello! Say hello!
I just want a chance to know you to know the woman deep inside
Yeah yeah (and) i dont wanna look back on life to see this missed opportunity
Yeah yeah (to get to know you)even at the rick of looking like a fool to you
I just want a chance to know you to know the love you have inside
Yeah yeah (and) I dont wanna look back on life to see this missed opportunity
Yeah yeah even at the risk of looking like a fool to you
Katrina will I ever know your heart?

Still Loving You 
Time, it needs time to win
back your love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, only love can bring
back your love someday
I will be there, I will be there
Try, baby, try to trust in my love again
I will be there, I will be there
Love, our love
just shouldn't be thrown away
I will be there, I will be there
If we'd go again
all the way from the start
I would try to change the things
that killed our love
Yes, I've hurt your pride
and I know what you've been through
You should give me a chance
this can't be the end
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you
I need your love
I'm still loving you
I'm still loving you, baby
I'm still loving you
